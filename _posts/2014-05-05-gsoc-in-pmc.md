Hello World!

I am selected in GSoC 2014 \o/ , and what makes it even better is the organisation, **[KDE](http://kde.org/)** and my mentors **[Shantanu Tushar](http://www.shantanutushar.com/)** and **[Peter Grasch](http://grasch.net/about)**. My project is "*Integrate Plasma Media Center with Simon*". The result of which will allow users to interact with [PMC](http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center) (Plasma Media Center) using voice commands.

The first step of my project was to make PMC [MPRIS](http://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/) compatible, so that it can accept commands from Simon or any other application using MPRIS specifications, and it is complete ([reviewboard](https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/117801/)). So, if you are building PMC from the latest source (pull and build again :P), you can now control PMC with the "*Now Playing*" desktop plasmoid. I'll post updates on my project as and when a development is made, so stay tuned!

Finally, I thank Google for conducting such a wonderful program to motivate students in contributing to open source projects and I thank my mentors and whole KDE community for giving me a chance to work with them.
